# Some Issues i faced

### i faced the logout recursion function call
    > this is because the view of logout functionality are named logout which is the same of the logout function    from django framework that take care of the logout user request.

### the Issue that django-auth provide many functionality (login,register,etc) that you may won't need
    > add some variables in settings.py that exclude and just define what pages you want to use from the library itself.
